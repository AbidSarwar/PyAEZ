# PyAEZ
PyAEZ is a python package consisted of many algorithms related to Agro-ecalogical zoning (AEZ) framework.

### Introduction
PyAEZ tries to encapsulate all complex calculations in AEZ and try to provide user friendly, and intuitive ways to input data and output results after calculations. PyAEZ
includes 5 main modules as below. Additionally to that, UtilityCalculations module is also included in PyAEZ to perform additional related utility calculations.

* Module I: Climate Regime
* Module II: Crop Simulations
* Module III: Climate Constraints
* Module IV: Soil Constraints
* Module V: Terrain Constraints
* UtilityCalculations Module

Other than 5 main modules and utility module, following 3 major algorithms related to AEZ also are included in PyAEZ. Those 3 major algorithms can be utilized individually without running whole PyAEZ.

* Biomass Calculations
* Evapotranspiration Calculations
* CropWat Calculations
